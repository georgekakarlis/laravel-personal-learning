# Laravel Learning

This is a repository contains all my learning path in Laravel. Including commented code , useful snippets and to actually document and structure my learning process better.
Feel free to suggest me different methods/paths to be more precise in order to understand this beautiful framework

It is not however a book-a-like or something like that. It is personal "diary" with pretty much a lot of commented-out-code, so when I have the need to look up something I search my own docs.

## Until now topic covered :

✅ How to install Laravel / Start a new application
✅ Explored the application. Composer.lock / vendor / etc
✅ Did some basic routing in routes/web.php file. Mostly on Laravel 8
✅ HTTP responses in Routing
✅ Studied about Controllers , Views and how to pass Data to Views.
